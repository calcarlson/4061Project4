# 4061Project4


1. The purpose of our project is to create two seperate programs, a client and a server, which implement synchronization and inter process communication.

2. How to compile the program

3. Our program has two elements, the client and the server. The server receives file path arguments from the client and then creates threads based on the number of files within that file path and finds the total number of words for each letter of the alphabet and stores those statistics in an array which is returned to the client. The client is in charge of traversing the file structure and dividing the text files among the client processes.
